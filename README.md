# Fluidised-bed-membrane-reactor

Fluidized bed membrane reactor model does not exist in the ASPEN PLUS. 
Therefore, a DELPHI executable code is built for one-dimensional two phase fluidization model for membrane-assisted fluidized bed reactor and integrated with ASPEN PLUS to simulate the hydrogen permeation through membrane. 
VBA code is written to integrate ASPEN PLUS and DELPHI executable model.
